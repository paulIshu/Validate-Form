# Form Validation Web Page

This project demonstrates a simple web page for form validation. Users can submit their personal information, and the provided JavaScript functions validate the input data in real-time. The validation functions check for the following criteria:

- Full Name: Checks for a non-empty name.
- Phone Number: Validates a valid phone number format (e.g., "123 456 7890").
- Email: Verifies a valid email address format.
- Message: Ensures that a message is provided.

If any of the input fields do not meet the validation criteria, error messages are displayed below the respective input fields.
