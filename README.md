Project Description
This code represents a basic form validation implementation for a web page. It allows users to submit their personal information, and the provided JavaScript functions validate the input data in real-time. The validation functions check for the following criteria:

Full Name: Checks for a non-empty name.
Phone Number: Validates a valid phone number format (e.g., "123 456 7890").
Email: Verifies a valid email address format.
Message: Ensures that a message is provided.
If any of the input fields do not meet the validation criteria, error messages are displayed below the respective input fields.

Files Included
The project includes the following files:

index.html: The HTML file that defines the structure of the form and includes the necessary JavaScript and CSS resources.
style.css: The CSS file for styling the form and error messages.
script.js: The JavaScript file containing the validation functions and form submission logic.
How to Use
To use this code, follow these steps:

Download the code files (index.html, style.css, and script.js) to your local machine or server.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
You will see the form with input fields for Full Name, Phone Number, Email, and a Message. Try entering data and observe the real-time validation and error messages.

Validation Rules
Full Name: The name field should not be empty.
Phone Number: The phone number field should match the format "123 456 7890" (10 digits separated by spaces).
Email: The email field should contain a valid email address format (e.g., "example@example.com").
Message: The message field should not be empty.
